            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The modern concept of "the homosexual" as a distinct type of person is not an eternal category but a historical invention. This digital archive traces a profound rupture in how Western culture has understood same-sex desire, contrasting the philosophical framework of classical Athens with the medicalized paradigm of late 19th-century Europe.</p>
            
            <p>By juxtaposing these two distant historical moments, this collection challenges the notion of a continuous, transhistorical "homosexuality" and instead reveals how our contemporary categories of sexual orientation are contingent constructions shaped by specific cultural, scientific, and political forces.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Central Argument</h2>
            <p>Michel Foucault identified the late 19th century as marking the "birth" of the modern homosexual, arguing that what had once been understood as the sin of sodomy—a prohibited act that anyone might commit—was transformed into homosexuality, a psychological condition that revealed one's deepest identity.</p>

            <p>This archive makes this abstract theoretical claim tangible through visual and textual evidence. Greek vase paintings show courtship scenes and symposium imagery that depict same-sex eros as an integrated aspect of civic and intellectual life, celebrated in visual culture without the stigma of abnormality. In contrast, Victorian medical illustrations, Freud's psychosexual development diagrams, and sexological case studies present same-sex desire as a condition to be diagnosed, explained, and controlled by expert knowledge.</p>

            <p><strong>The archive ultimately argues that our contemporary categories of sexual orientation—homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual—are not discoveries of natural facts but historical inventions created through specific regimes of power and knowledge.</strong></p>

            <h2>Explore the Archive</h2>
            <p>This digital archive is organized into two primary sections, each presenting visual and textual sources that illuminate fundamentally different ways of understanding human desire:</p>
            
            <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)); gap: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Classical Athens (5th-4th century BCE): Same-sex desire understood through frameworks of philosophy, ethics, and pedagogy. No concept of sexual identity—only acts evaluated by context.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Late 19th-century Europe: Medical and psychiatric discourses create "the homosexual" as a distinct human type. Same-sex desire reconceptualized as pathology and identity.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">This digital archive was created as a final project to investigate the transformation in Western understandings of same-sex desire from antiquity to modernity. Through careful juxtaposition of visual and textual sources from two distant historical epochs, the project seeks to denaturalize contemporary assumptions about sexual identity and reveal the contingent, constructed nature of our current categories.</p>
